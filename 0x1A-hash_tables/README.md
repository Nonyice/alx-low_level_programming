# Solutions to tasks on Hash tables

Hash are data sructures which optimally assigns keys as values in such a way that each item can be traced by calling the indexed valu
This is achievable through a hash function almost an implementation linked list data structure. The speed of data retrieval is one which is O() efficient is an advantage of the hash table over arrays and linked list.
In cases of collision, a node is linked to the index with collision a linked list of colided keys. We can therefore say that a hash table is an array of linked lists and makes for more efficiency in data retrieval.
